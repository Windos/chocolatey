## Azure Account VSCode Extension

The Azure Account extension provides a single Azure sign-in and subscription filtering experience for all other Azure extensions. It makes Azure's Cloud Shell service available in VS Code's integrated terminal.

The purpose of this Chocolatey package is to perform the initial install of the Azure Account extension for Visual Studio Code.
The extension will automatically update within VS Code going forward.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
